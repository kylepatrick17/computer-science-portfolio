    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <a id=contents href="new000.html">table of contents</a>
    <p>I'm Kyle Patrick and I'm in 9th grade. I go to Summit and I went to Central Middle School, White Oaks Elementary, 
        and Marin day care for preschool.In my life I have always lived in San Carlos in the same house as well. I enjoy
        playing soccer tennis with my friends at the park I feel that really sums up what I am and who I am. I enjoy soccer
        and hanging out with friends. I am a sucker for anything that looks really nice in the way its put together or has a
        really mettalic look. Another thing I really like is soccer boots they really interest me. They look great and they have 
        a lot of functionality.In my free time I play fifa with friends, read, walk my dog, hang out with friends, play soccer with them,
        go into the tunnels with them, watch soccer,and listen to music. The reason I enjoy playing fifa with friends is its very
        competitive and I'm a competitive person. I also enjoy playing because I love playing soccer.Fifa is a good way to channel
        that passion. I read because I find it enjoyable and I learn lots of new things because of it. It also is a great thing to 
        do before I go to sleep. I enjoy walking my dog because it gives me time to think and it lets me bond with my dog.I enjoy
        hanging out with friends because its fun and I learn a lot through our conversations we really bring each other up and make 
        each other better.I enjoy watching soccer because it once again lets me explore my love for soccer. I always watch with friends
        and/or family. We always bond and have a good time.
