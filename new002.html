    <p>I learned a lot about Html and CSS. Khan Academy was my main learning medium. Html stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language. It is used to make websites.
        Html was created 22 years ago but the latest iteration was october 2014. Its written using tags. CSS stands for cascading style sheets. Its is used embbeded or
        external. If you want to use it embbeded you need the style tag. It was made 18 years ago. It is written using classes id's and colors. A tag is a command that 
        the computer can read and perform. You write one buy surrounding a command in sideways triangles. To change attributes you need to surround the attribute 
        with :;. 4 commands that I learned are the style tag which allows you use CSS in the same document as the HTML. The next tag is span it allows you add css 
        effects to the area you spanned. Another tag I learned is the br tag which is like pressing enter on google docs. final tag is the h tag which makes headings.
