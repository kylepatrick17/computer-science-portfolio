        <h1>My Bot</h1>
        <li>Name: Kyle_</li>
        <li>Purpose: Capture mines and gain more gold than the other bots.</li>
        <li>Uses javascript to attack enemy bots, capture mines and go to taverns.</li>
        <br>

        <h2>Kyle_Bot Says "Hi"</h2>
        <img src="http://vindinium.org/assets/img/ui/player3.png" width="150" height="150">
        <div>Hi I'm Kyle_Bot! I'm a bot that fights other bots on vindinium.org.<br>
        I have three functions:
        <li>Capture Mines</li>
        <li>Go to taverns</li>
        <li>Attack other bot</li></div>
        <br>
        <h3>Bot Decision Making Process</h3>
        <code>
            <pre>
                 if(bot.yourBot.life < 60 ){
            task = "taverns";
        }
        else{
            task = "freemines";
        }                     
            </pre>
        </code>
        <p>This if else statement tells my bot what to do based on how much health it has.
        <br>If my bot has less than 60 health then it will perform the task taverns.
        If my bot is at 60 health or above my bot will perform the task freemines.</p>
        <h3>Capturing Mines</h3><br>
        <code>
            <pre>
                if(task === "freemines") {4
            var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.freeMines[i])) {
                    closestMine = bot.freeMines[i];
                }
            </pre>
        </code>
        <p>This code is responsible for my bot being able to capture mines. This code works
        by <br> figuring out what the task is to be completed and if the task id "freemines"
        the code gets run. This code starts by identifying how many mines there are and where they are on the map.
        <br> Then my bot finds which mine is the closest. After finding the closest mine the bot finds the best
        <br> route to get to the mine.
        </p>
        <h4>Going to Taverns</h4><br>
        <code>
            <pre>
                 if(task === "taverns")  {
            var closestTavern = bot.taverns[0]; 
                for(i= 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos,  closestTavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];
            </pre>
        </code>
        <p>This code is responsible for my bot being able to go to taverns. This code works
        by <br> figuring out what task is to be completed and if the task id reads "taverns"
        the code gets run. This code starts by identifying how many taverns there are and where they are on the map.
        <br> Then my bot finds which tavern is the closest. After finding the closest tavern the bot finds the best
        <br> route to get to the tavern.
        </p>
        <h5>Attacking Bots</h5><br>
        <code>
            <pre>
                var closestBot = bot.enemyBots[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.enemyBots.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.enemyBots[i])) {
                    closestBot = bot.enemyBots[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("CHAAARRRGGGEE!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestBot);
            </pre>
        </code>
        <p>This code tells my robot when to attack other bots. My robot a My robot attacks when it is closer to an enemybot than a freemine 
        then the bot will try to attack the nearby bot. This code works by identifying where the bots are on the map
        and then find how far away enemy bots are and if an enemy bot is closer to my bot than
        a mine my bot will find a path to the bot and go there re routing if needed every turn also if a mine opens up that is closer
        to my bot than the enemy bot my bot will disengage and go for the mine.
        </p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>For the most part my bot did what I wanted to do. My bot attacks other bots it takes free mines and 
        <br>goes to taverns. The code was simple but I had a hard time figuring it out. I have a different view on ai as I didn't
        quite understand how some ai works. Originally I thought ai was some magical thing but after programming the bot I relized that 
        some ai can be as simple as a decision tree responding to external inputs.<br>
        My opinion of ai has changed a lot I think that ai presents an interesting future that will have more
        efficient work force that also has less needs.</p>
